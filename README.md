# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Deliverables
 -  Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
 -  Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
 -  Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results

June Temperature Statistics :

Both tables are showing differing weather patterns for both monthly periods (June and December). Takeaways from this include :

 - The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are relatively close ot one another.
 - The average temperatures between June (75) and December (71), with very little fluctuation from both months from an average standpoint.
 - The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) have the greatest variance of temperatures, and displays a much lower temperature level in December that may not be favorable for both ice cream and surfing.
# Summary

Overall, the December weather and the June weather are statistically very similar, although December's (weather) has a wider range of possible results, with its highs being close to June's (weather) but its lows being well below June's (weather).
